# AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection System

## üìñ 1. Project Overview

This project is an advanced spell correction system specifically engineered to handle spelling errors in non-English words (such as Hindi and Marathi) that are written using the English (Roman) alphabet. The system's primary objective is to take a large text file containing misspelled words (`errors.txt`) and produce a corrected version by intelligently matching each word against a comprehensive dictionary of correct spellings (`reference.txt`).

The core challenge lies in the unique nature of errors in romanized text, which include not only standard typographical mistakes but also phonetic deviations and inconsistent transliterations. To address this, the project implements a sophisticated hybrid algorithm that combines phonetic encoding with string similarity metrics to achieve high accuracy and efficiency.

## ‚ú® 2. Features

- **Multi-Model Approach:** Implements and compares three powerful CNN architectures: **EfficientNetB0**, **ResNet50**, and **MobileNetV2**.
- **High Accuracy:** Utilizes **transfer learning** from models pre-trained on ImageNet to achieve high accuracy with a smaller dataset.
- **Robust Training:** Employs **data augmentation** (random rotations, flips, shifts) to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen images.
- **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** Uses a two-phase training strategy, starting with training a custom classification head and then fine-tuning the deeper layers of the pre-trained model for optimal performance.
- **Model Explainability:** Includes **Grad-CAM** (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to generate heatmaps that visualize which parts of an image the model is focusing on, ensuring the model is learning relevant disease features.

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Technical Approach

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Consolidation:** A Python script processes and combines nine different public Kaggle datasets into a single, unified CSV file (`kaggle_dataset_manifest.csv`) that maps each image to its correct crop and disease label.
2.  **Data Splitting:** The consolidated dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.
3.  **Model Building:** For each architecture (EfficientNet, etc.), the pre-trained base is loaded, and a new classification head is added on top.
4.  **Training:** The model is trained using the two-phase approach (base training followed by fine-tuning) with callbacks like `EarlyStopping` and `ReduceLROnPlateau` to optimize the training process.
5.  **Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the unseen test set to generate a **classification report** (with precision, recall, F1-score) and a **confusion matrix**.

## üöÄ 4. Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation
1.  Place all project files in a single directory.
2.  Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3.  Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Program
1.  First, generate the dataset manifest by running the data preparation script (the first cell in the notebook or a standalone script).
2.  To train the models, run the main training script. In the provided notebook, this is the cell that calls the `train_model()` function.
3.  After training, run the evaluation script to see the performance metrics and visualizations.

## üìÅ 5. File Structure

- **`crop-disease-detection.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow from data preparation to model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **`reference.txt` & `errors.txt`**: (Note: These files seem to be from a different project and are not used in this notebook.)
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing all Python library dependencies (e.g., `tensorflow`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file.
- **Output Files (Generated by the script):**
    - `kaggle_dataset_manifest.csv`: The master list of all image paths and labels.
    - `*.h5`: The saved, trained model files (e.g., `efficientnetb0_disease_model.h5`).
    - `*_info.json`: JSON files containing training history and other metadata for each model.
